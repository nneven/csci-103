NOTE: You can delete the questions, we only need your responses.

NOTE: It is helpful if you write at most 80 characters per line,
and avoid including special characters, so we can read your responses.

Please summarize the help you found useful for this assignment, which
may include office hours, discussion with peers, tutors, et cetera.
Saying "a CP on Tuesday" is ok if you don't remember their name.
If none, say "none".

================================ Questions ==================================

1. Which kind of a loop did you use to iterate through the nights of a
   single simulation?  Why?
   
:  A while loop, this is because you do not know beforehand how many times you
   need to iterate for the entire population to become zombies, this is 
   dependent of the rand() function.

2. Which kind of a loop did you use to perform the M simulations? Why?

:  A for loop, this is because I know how exactly how many times I need to
   iterate before starting the loop. It is based off the user input for M.

3. How did you ensure that if a human was turned into a zombie on a
   particular night that he/she didn't bite anyone until the following
   night?

:  I would first count how many zombies there were from the previous night, then
   infect that many times, before incrementing the night and recounting the 
   zombies.

4. Experiment briefly running your program with fewer simulations 
   (smaller M value). One thing computer scientists do often is evaluate 
   trade-offs. Running with a smaller M results in some interesting 
   trade-offs: your program output three values, Average Nights, Max Nights 
   and Min Nights. How will these values be impacted by running fewer 
   simulations? On the other hand, what other property of your program is 
   affected by using a smaller M?

:  With smaller M values (fewer simulations), the min and max values I get are
   less extreme and closer to the average, because there is less of a chance
   that the rand() function generates an outlier scenario where the zombies
   infect either very fast or extremely slowly. The average on the other hand is
   less accurate using small M values due to the law of large numbers. There
   more simulations that get run, the more times the "average" number has chance
   of becoming generated, and it becomes more and more accurate. With less
   simulations, the opposite happens. In general, using a smaller M meant less
   simulations, meaning less random numbers were generated, meaning the results
   were also less random.

5. (Optional Challenge -- Ungraded)
   You do not need to submit an answer if you prefer not to.) 
   Given a population of N and k initial zombies, can you find an expression
   for the theoretical minimum number of nights it would take for everyone
   to become a zombie?

================================ Remarks ====================================

Filling in anything here is OPTIONAL.

Approximately how long did you spend on this assignment?

: 2-3 hours

Were there any specific problems you encountered? This is especially useful to
know if you turned it in incomplete.

: It was unclear if we were to consider the first night as 0 or 1 in terms of 
  indexing. It was also frustrating to find out that writing my program outside
  of Vocareum and compiling/running it through terminal would generate different
  outputs even with the same seed and inputs. I spent at least an hour trying to
  debug my code before just copying it to Vocareum and having it work perfectly
  on the first go.

Do you have any other remarks?
