================================ Questions ==================================

1. Which kind of a loop did you use to iterate through the nights of a
   single simulation?  Why?
   
:

2. Which kind of a loop did you use to perform the M simulations? Why?

   
:


3. How did you ensure that if a human was turned into a zombie on a
   particular night that he/she didn't bite anyone until the following
   night?

:


4. Experiment briefly running your program with fewer simulations 
   (smaller M value). One thing computer scientists do often is evaluate 
   trade-offs. Running with a smaller M results in some interesting 
   trade-offs: your program output three values, Average Nights, Max Nights 
   and Min Nights. How will these values be impacted by running fewer 
   simulations? On the other hand, what other property of your program is 
   affected by using a smaller M?

:

5. (Optional Challenge -- Ungraded)
    You do not need to submit an answer if you prefer not to.) 
   Given a population of N and k initial zombies, can you find an expression
   for the theoretical minimum number of nights it would take for everyone
   to become a zombie?
