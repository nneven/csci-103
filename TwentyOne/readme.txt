NOTE: You can delete the questions, we only need your responses.

NOTE: It is helpful if you write at most 80 characters per line,
and avoid including special characters, so we can read your responses.

Please summarize the help you found useful for this assignment, which
may include office hours, discussion with peers, tutors, et cetera.
Saying "a CP on Tuesday" is ok if you don't remember their name.
If none, say "none".

================================ Questions ==================================

1. Did you use the 'suit', 'type' and 'value' arrays? What functions are easier
to implement when using these arrays? How do you use them?

: The three arrays made the printCard() and cardValue() functions easer to
  implement. By using division and modulus operations, I was able to translate
  the card's id into its readable characteristics.

2. Did you add any additional functions to your implementation? If so briefly
describe how the functions improved your solution.

: No, I did not.

3. There are many ways to shuffle the deck of cards. The method used in our
implementation generates a permutaion of the cards to shuffle. For an array of
size N, how many swap (exchange) operations does this algorithm do? Does the
algorithm require any extra memory to generate a permutation?

: It performs N swap (exchange) operations. Yes, the algorithim requires extra
  memory. This is because a temp variable must be created and store the value of
  cards[i] while its value is being replaced with cards[j].
